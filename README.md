# About the assignment
I provideed the [assignment](./COL215_HW_Assignment_3x3_filter.pdf) pdf.
[Previous assignment](./HW_Assignment_2.pdf) is also provided for reference.

## Implementations
In the [source code](./hw3.srcs/sources_1/new/) you can find these implemented.
You can use this repository as a reference if you want.
- Reading from and Writin to RAM
- Loading a .coe file into ROM and reading from it.
- Finite State Machines


# Notes

If for some reason, this doesnt work, please shift to the `submission` branch.
That was the code that I've submitted.

I wrote comments in the source code to try to explain the project's layout.
I've written these comments after a long time of making this assignment,
so things may not be accurate.

## Some Notes to Juniors

If you are doing this course and feel very overwhelmed by the contents, 
my advice on this course is: This course is like learning to build a car.
You donot need to learn how to build a car, learning how to drive one is enough.
But, if you understand how a car is built, you can drive / customize it better.

I read the first few chapters of a book from our library called `Computer architecture and organizaion by Hayes, John P`.
It maynot teach you the course, but it will provide you enough history/motivation on why things are so.
I read that book when I was doing COL216, specifically the topic on FPGAs, i really hoped that 
I knew about this when doing COL215.
This book also gave me the same feelings: `Digital Design and Computer Architecture by David Harris and Sarah Harris`.
